				<p><a href="../Research.html">Pilot Project</a> 2 (PP2): An Underutilized Pathway to Reducing 
				Adolescent Obesity: Translating the Results of Adult-oriented Interventions into Their 
				Children’s Obesity-related Behaviors and Outcomes.  PI, 
					<a href="http://nursing.umich.edu/faculty-staff/minkyoung-song">MinKyoung Song</a> PhD, RN, School of 
					Nursing and Co-I, William Herman MD, MPH, Director, Michigan Diabetes Research and Training Center

				Obesity in adolescents has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. As a chronic 
				condition, adolescent obesity increases risk for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, 
				hyperlipidemia, low self-esteem, and depression. Obese adolescents are at increased risk 
				for poor health outcomes as they become adults.[27-29] One way to address adolescent obesity 
				is with interventions that target their parents’ behaviors and attitudes. Weight loss in 
				parents is positively associated with weight changes in their obese children and it is known 
				that adolescents’ behaviors are strongly influenced by parental behaviors. There have been a 
				few clinical interventions that addressed childhood obesity by targeting health behaviors 
				of parents, and their results showed that interventions that target parents only are as 
				effective as those that target parents and children together. However, to date, no 
				interventions directed at reducing adolescent obesity by targeting parents have been 
				implemented in real-world, community-based settings. Moreover, there has not been a 
				thorough assessment of the underlying mechanisms of how changes in parental behaviors 
				influence adolescents’ weight-related behaviors and health outcomes. Preexisting, ongoing 
				community programs that address obesity in parents offer a rich environment for understanding 
				the real world implications of clinical findings on the relationships among parental 
				behaviors, family dynamics, and adolescent health.   
				
				The long term goal of PP2 is to develop effective interventions that reduce adolescent 
				obesity through community-based programs. Blue Care Network of Michigan (BCN) (the largest 
				health maintenance organization in Michigan), through its “Healthy Blue Living (HBL)” 
				program, has incentivized, community-based weight-management programs. Weight Watchers, 
				a popular traditional obesity management program, is one of the HBL weight-management programs
				for obese adults. We believe that Weight Watchers provides a valuable opportunity for 
				assessing whether, or to what degree, parent participation and success in weight-management 
				programs also affects the health of adolescent children living in the same household. 
				
				A previous study of HBL showed that participation of obese adults lowered their 
				cardiovascular risk factors, and lowered the rate of increase in their direct medical costs. 
				However, no studies have examined the indirect effects on children of the adult participants 
				within the context of the family. Approximately 84 obese parents and their adolescent 
				children (aged 11 to 17 years) will be recruited from parents who are primary caregivers and 
				who have decided to participate in Weight Watchers but have not yet started to participate.
				The specific aims of this study are to:<br>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Aim 1: Assess family functioning, parental behaviors, adolescent children behaviors, 
						and body mass index (BMI)/waist circumference-to-height ratio (WCHt) of obese parents 
						participating in Weight Watchers and their adolescent children at baseline; and 
						compare the baselines with measures taken 3 months after enrollment. </li>
					<li> Hypothesis: There will be positive changes (e.g., improved physical activity and 
						diet) between baseline and post-3 months in Weight Watchers participants.</li>
					<li>Aim 2: Assess whether changes in family dynamics mediate the effect of changes in 
						parental behaviors on changes in adolescent behaviors and BMI/WCHt. </li>
					<li> Hypothesis: Parental behaviors are positively associated with changes in family 
						dynamics which are in turn accompanied by positive changes in adolescent behaviors 
						and BMI/WCHt.</li>
					<li> Aim 3: Assess the parents’ perception of the utility and influence of Weight 
						Watchers intervention on family dynamics and parental behaviors by conducting 
						structured qualitative interviews with parents at post-3 months.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p> We expect that results from this, mixed-methods study will contribute to our 
					understanding whether existing parent-oriented weight management programs can improve 
					the BMI/WCHt and behavior of adolescent children living in the family. Ultimately, we 
					expect that successful completion of this research will (a) increase our understanding 
					of how parental behaviors and family dynamics influence adolescent health and (b) 
					provide data to guide a larger study of preexisting, high reach, and relatively 
					low-cost programs to target adolescent obesity. </p>
