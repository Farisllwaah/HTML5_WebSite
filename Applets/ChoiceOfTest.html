	<p><br>
	In terms of selecting a statistical test, the most important question
	is "what is the main study hypothesis?" In some cases there is no
	hypothesis; the investigator just wants to "see what is there". For
	example, in a prevalence study there is no hypothesis to test, and the
	size of the study is determined by how accurately the investigator
	wants to determine the prevalence. If there is no hypothesis, then
	there is no statistical test. It is important to decide <em
	 class="italic">a priori </em>which
	hypotheses are confirmatory (that is, are testing some presupposed
	relationship), and which are exploratory (are suggested by the data).
	No single study can support a whole series of hypotheses.</p>
	<p>A
	sensible plan is to limit severely the number of confirmatory
	hypotheses. Although it is valid to use statistical tests on hypotheses
	suggested by the data, the P values should be used only as guidelines,
	and the results treated as very tentative until confirmed by subsequent
	studies. A useful guide is to use a <em class="italic">Bonferroni</em>
	correction, which states simply that if one is testing n independent
	hypotheses, one should use a significance level of 0.05/n. Thus if
	there were two independent hypotheses a result would be declared
	significant only if P&lt;0.025. Note that, since tests are rarely
	independent, this is a very conservative procedure - one unlikely to
	reject the null hypothesis.</p>
	<p>The investigator should then ask
	"are the data independent?" This can be difficult to decide but as a
	rule of thumb results on the same individual, or from matched
	individuals, are not independent. Thus results from a crossover trial,
	or from a case control study in which the controls were matched to the
	cases by age, sex and social class, are not independent. It is
	generally true that the analysis should reflect the design, and so a
	matched design should be followed by a matched analysis. Results
	measured over time require special care. One of the most common
	mistakes in statistical analysis is to treat dependent variables as
	independent. For example, suppose we were looking at treatment of leg
	ulcers, in which some people had an ulcer on each leg. We might have 20
	subjects with 30 ulcers but the number of independent pieces of
	information is 20 because the state of an ulcer on one leg may
	influence the state of the ulcer on the other leg and an analysis that
	considered ulcers as independent observations would be incorrect. For a
	correct analysis of mixed paired and unpaired data consult a
	statistician.</p>
	<p>The next question is "what types of data are
	being measured?" The test used should be determined by the data. The
	choice of test for matched or paired data is described in and for
	independent data in .</p></br>

	<p>It is helpful to decide the <u><font color="#cc33cc"><big><b><em
	 class="italic">input</em></b></big></font></u> variables and the <font
	 color="#cc33cc"><u><big><b><em class="italic">outcome</em></b></big></u></font>
	variables. For example in a clinical trial the input variable is type
	of treatment - a nominal variable - and the outcome may be some
	clinical measure perhaps Normally distributed. The required test is
	then the <i>T-<em class="italic"></em></i>test. However, if the input
	variable is continuous, say a clinical score, and the outcome is
	nominal, say cured or not cured, logistic regression is the required
	analysis. A <em class="italic">t </em>test in this case may help but
	would not give us what we require, namely the probability of a cure for
	a given value of the clinical score. As another example, suppose we
	have a cross sectional study in which we ask a random sample of people
	whether they think their general practitioner is doing a good job, on a
	five point scale, and we wish to ascertain whether women have a higher
	opinion of general practitioners than men have. The input variable is
	gender, which is nominal. The outcome variable is the five point
	ordinal scale. Each person's opinion is independent of the others, so
	we have independent data. From <a href="ChoiceOfTest.html#19120"
	 class="XRef">here</a> we know we should use a <img
	 src="ChoiceOfTest_files/13-9.gif" align="middle">
	test for trend, or a Mann-Whitney U test (with correction for ties).
	Note, however, if some people share a general practitioner and others
	do not, then the data are not independent and a more sophisticated
	analysis is called for.</p>
	<p>Note that these tables should be considered as guides only, and each
	case should be considered on its merits. </p></br></br>

	The Kruskal-Wallis test is used for comparing ordinal or non-Normal
	variables for more than two groups, and is a generalisation of the
	Mann-Whitney U test. The technique is beyond the scope of this book,
	but is described in more advanced books<a href="ChoiceOfTest.html#20280"
	 class="XRef"> </a>and is available in common software (Epi-Info,
	Minitab, SPSS).</p>
	<p>(c)
	Analysis of variance is a general technique, and one version (one way
	analysis of variance) is used to compare Normally distributed variables
	for more than two groups, and is the parametric equivalent of the
	Kruskal-Wallis test.</p>
	<p>(d) If the outcome variable is the
	dependent variable, then provided the residuals (see ) are plausibly
	Normal, then the distribution of the independent variable is not
	important.</p>
	<p>(e) There are a number of more advanced techniques,
	such as Poisson regression, for dealing with these situations. However,
	they require certain assumptions and it is often easier to either
	dichotomise the outcome variable or treat it as continuous.</p>

	<p>13.1
	To investigate the relationship between egg consumption and heart
	disease, a group of patients admitted to hospital with myocardial
	infarction were questioned about their egg consumption. A group of age
	and sex matched patients admitted to a fracture clinic were also
	questioned about their egg consumption using an identical protocol.</p>

	<p>13.2
	To investigate the relationship between certain solvents and cancer,
	all employees at a factory were questioned about their exposure to an
	industrial solvent, and the amount and length of exposure measured.
	These subjects were regularly monitored, and after 10 years a copy of
	the death certificate for all those who had died was obtained.</p>

	<p>13.3
	A survey was conducted of all nurses employed at a particular hospital.
	Among other questions, the questionnaire asked about the grade of the
	nurse and whether she was satisfied with her career prospects.</p>

	<p>13.4
	To evaluate a new back school, patients with lower back pain were
	randomly allocated to either the new school or to conventional
	occupational therapy. After 3 months they were questioned about their
	back pain, and observed lifting a weight by independent monitors.</p>

	<p>In many ways the design of a study is more important than the
	analysis.
	A badly designed study can never be retrieved, whereas a poorly
	analysed one can usually be reanalysed. Consideration of design is also
	important because the design of a study will govern how the data are to
	be analysed.</p>
	<p>Most medical studies consider an input, which may
	be a medical intervention or exposure to a potentially toxic compound,
	and an output, which is some measure of health that the intervention is
	supposed to affect. The simplest way to categorise studies is with
	reference to the time sequence in which the input and output are
	studied.</p>
	<p>The most powefful studies are <em class="italic">prospective</em>
	studies, and the paradigm for these is the <em class="italic">randomised
	controlled</em>
	trial. In this subjects with a disease are randomised to one of two (or
	more) treatments, one of which may be a control treatment. Methods of
	randomisation have been described in. The importance of randomisation
	is that we Imow in the long run treatment groups will be balanced in
	known and <em class="italic">unknown</em> prognostic factors. It is
	important that the treatments are <em class="italic">concurrent</em> -
	that the active and control treatments occur in the same period of time.</p>
	<p>A <em class="italic">parallel group</em>
	design is one in which treatment and control are allocated to different
	individuals. To allow for the therapeutic effect of simply being given
	treatment, the control may consist of a <em class="italic">placebo</em>
	, an inert substance that is physically identical to the active
	compound. If possible a study should be<em class="italic"> double
	blinded</em>
	- neither the investigator nor the subject being aware of what
	treatment the subject is undergoing. Sometimes it is impossible to
	blind the subjects, for example when the treatment is some form of
	health education, but often it is possible to ensure that the people
	evaluating the outcome are unaware of the treatment. An example of a
	parallel group trial is given in, in which different bran preparations
	have been tested on different individuals.</p>
	<p>A <em class="italic">matched</em>
	design comes about when randomisation is between matched pairs, such as
	in, in which randomisation was between different parts of a patient's
	body.</p>
	<p>A <em class="italic">crossover</em> study is one in which
	two or more treatments are applied sequentially to the same subject.
	The advantages are that each subject then acts as their own control and
	so fewer subjects may be required. The main disadvantage is that there
	may be a carry over effect in that the action of the second treatment
	is affected by the first treatment. An example of a crossover trial is
	given in, in which different dosages of bran are compared within the
	same individual. A number of excellent books are available on clinical
	trials.</p>
	<p>One of the major threats to validity of a clinical
	trial is compliance. Patients are likely to drop out of trials if the
	treatment is unpleasant, and often fail to take medication as
	prescribed. It is usual to adopt a pragmatic approach and analyse by <em
	 class="italic">intention to treat</em>
	, that is analyse the study by the treatment that the subject was
	assigned to, not the one they actually took. The alternative is to
	analyse <em class="italic">per protocol</em> or <em class="italic">on
	study</em> . Drop outs should of course be reported by treatment group.
	A checklist for writing reports on clinical trials is available.</p>
	<p>A <em class="italic">quasi experimental</em>
	design is one in which treatment allocation is not random. An example
	of this is given in in which injuries are compared in two dropping
	zones. This is subject to potential biases in that the reason why a
	person is allocated to a particular dropping zone may be related to
	their risk of a sprained ankle.</p>
	<p>A <em class="italic">cohort </em>study
	is one in which subjects, initially disease free, are followed up over
	a period of time. Some will be exposed to some risk factor, for example
	cigarette smoking. The outcome may be death and we may be interested in
	relating the risk factor to a particular cause of death. Clearly, these
	have to be large, long term studies and tend to be costly to carry out.
	If records have been kept routinely in the past then a historical
	cohort study may be carried out. Here, the cohort is all cases of
	appendicitis admitted over a given period and a sample of the records
	could be inspected retrospectively. A typical example would be to look
	at birth weight records and relate birth weight to disease in later
	life.</p>
	<p>These studies differ in essence from retrospective
	studies, which start with diseased subjects and then examine possible
	exposure. Such <em class="italic">case control</em> studies are
	commonly undertaken as a preliminary investigation, because they are
	relatively quick and inexpensive. The comparison of the blood pressure
	in farmers and printers&nbsp;<a href="http://bmj.com/statsbk/3.html"></a>is
	an example of a case control study. It is retrospective because we
	argued from the blood pressure to the occupation and did not start out
	with subjects assigned to occupation. There are many confounding
	factors in case control studies. For example, does occupational stress
	cause high blood pressure, or do peop
	le prone to high blood pressure choose stressful occupations? A
	particular problem is recall bias, in that the cases, with the disease,
	are more motivated to recall apparently trivial episodes in the past
	than controls, who are disease free.</p>
	<p><em class="italic">Cross sectional</em>
	studies are common and include surveys, laboratory experiments and
	studies to examine the prevalence of a disease. Studies validating
	instruments and questionnaires are also cross sectional studies. The
	study of urinary concentration of lead in children and the study of the
	relationship between height and pulmonary anatomical dead space were
	also cross sectional studies.</p>

	<p>One of the most common questions asked of a statistician about
	design
	is the number of patients to include. It is an important question,
	because if a study is too small it will not be able to answer the
	question posed, and would be a waste of time and money. It could also
	be deemed unethical because patients may be put at risk with no
	apparent benefit. However, studies should not be too large because
	resources would be wasted if fewer patients would have sufficed. The
	sample size depends on four critical quantities: the type I and type II
	error rates <img src="ChoiceOfTest_files/13-1.gif" align="middle"> and
	<img src="ChoiceOfTest_files/13-2.gif" align="middle"> , the
	variability of the data <img src="ChoiceOfTest_files/13-3.gif"
	 align="middle">
	, and the effect size d. In a trial the effect size is the amount by
	which we would expect the two treatments to differ, or is the
	difference that would be clinically worthwhile.</p>
	<p class="Body"><a name="pgfId=998436"></a>Usually <img
	 src="ChoiceOfTest_files/13-4.gif" align="middle"> and <img
	 src="ChoiceOfTest_files/13-5.gif" align="middle">
	are fixed at 5% and 20% (or 10%) respectively. A simple formula for a
	two group parallel trial with a continuous outcome is that the required
	sample size per group is given by <img
	 src="ChoiceOfTest_files/13-6.gif" align="middle"> for two sided <img
	 src="ChoiceOfTest_files/13-7.gif" align="middle"> of 5% and <img
	 src="ChoiceOfTest_files/13-8.gif" align="middle">
	of 20%. For example, in a trial to reduce blood pressure, if a
	clinically worthwhile effect for diastolic blood pressure is 5 mmHg and
	the between subjects standard deviation is 10 mmHg, we would require n
	= 16 x 100/25 = 64 patients per group in the study. The sample size
	goes up as the square of the standard deviation of the data (the
	variance) and goes down inversely as the square of the effect size.
	Doubling the effect size reduces the sample size by four - it is much
	easier to detect large effects! In practice, the sample size is often
	fixed by other criteria, such as finance or resources, and the formula
	is used to determine a realistic effect size. If this is too large,
	then the study will have to be abandoned or increased in size. Machin <em
	 class="italic">et al.</em> give advice on a sample size calculations
	for a wide variety of study designs.</p>
